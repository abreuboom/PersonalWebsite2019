          Outside of programming, I am passionate about creating things that
          inspire others to create! My creative outlets of choice are portrait
          photography and graphic design
          <br />
          I’ve been programming in some capacity since 2012 through CS class at
          my high school but I really got my start in the tech industry through
          a program called All Star Code in 2015
